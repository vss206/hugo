##### Installing Docker
Docker is installed via package manager.

###### Arch Linux

```yaml
$ sudo pacman -S docker
```

###### Debian/Ubuntu Linux
```yaml
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
```


#### Starting Docker Engine
Start the Docker daemon which provides the Docker Engine. This process serves the Docker API and manages Docker containers.
```yaml
$ sudo systemctl start docker.service
```


If you want Docker Engine to automatically start when you system boots issue the below command.
```yaml
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service
```
Verify that Docker Engine is running.
```yaml
$ docker info
```
Verify that you can run containers. The below will download the latest Arch Linux image and use it to run a "Hello World" bash script in the container.
```yaml
$ docker run -it --rm archlinux bash
```
