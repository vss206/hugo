I’m a Linux enthusiast. I use a GNU+Linux distribution called **Debian Linux**. Yeah no, I’m not an arch/gentoo fanboi, I just love using the debian as it fits my needs. I also use a window manager called i3 instead of using a desktop environment(been using i3 for about 3 years now, ain’t gonna change anytime soon).

I started coding at grade 11 (11th standard in Indian terms). For me, I was attracted to computers by technology and computer from my childhood and during the COVID-19 lockdown when everything was completely shut off, where I developed interest towards **Linux, Development, AI** And **Higher Mathematics**.

## Reading stuff

I like books on fiction, Non-fiction, Self Help, Philosophy 🌟. I try my best to complete at least one book in 3-4 months. If you got a good book to share, don't forget me!
